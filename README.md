# Relay Recipes
This is a community maintained, non-official resource for people using Relay. It contains recipes for using Relay in various common (and uncommon!) ways.

## Goal
The goal of this resource is:
- To provide a natural place, indexable by search engines, where recipes for using Relay can be gathered and discussed in a transparent way
- Provide a large body of valuable information that's accessible for anyone to use however they want via the GitHub API

## How does it work?
Post new recipes, discuss recipes and post request for recipes you'd like to see!
